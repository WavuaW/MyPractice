The entries in all caps are constants - 'BASIC_FORMAT'
The capitalized items are classes - 'BufferingFormatter'
The that start with lowercase are methods - 'captureWarnings'

In the logging module, the six constants are:
    NOTSET - 0
    DEBUG - 10
    INFO - 20
    WARNING - 30
    ERROR - 40
    CRITICAL - 50

The default is warning, this means it will catch everything > 30
