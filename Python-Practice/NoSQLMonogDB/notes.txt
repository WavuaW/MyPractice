no SQL/ Not only SQL

The primaey question for working with document databases
    To embed or not to embed (same record or two separate collections)
    1. Is the embeded data wanted 80% of the time? - If yes then we'd want to embed
    2. How often do you want the emdedded data without the containing document?
    3. Is the embedded data a bounded set? no to unbounded set
    4. Is that bound small? no larger than 16MB
    5. How varied are your queries? The more specific your queries are the more likely tp embed
    6. Is this an intergration DB or an application DB?
